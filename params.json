In crowd computing, the users send tasks to the crowd, instead. Tasks can be (1) “computational” or (2) “human”.\r\n\r\nIn the first one, users distribute code to execute to other users’ computers; in the second one, users distribute micro-tasks (translating a piece of text, answering a question) to other users. Examples: (computational) user can ask other users to download censored web pages or fold proteins for a university, (human) in Haiti most of the help messages were written in Kriol, now Humanitarian Relief No-profits can distribute text to be translated to anyone speaking Kriol around the world can be a rescue worker saving lives from their houses with their iPads.\r\n\r\nAll this is requires no installation (through browser & webRTC)\r\n\r\n## A bit of history\r\n\r\nAbout 1 year and a half ago (April 2013), [me](https://github.com/nicola), [@rmharrisom](https://github.com/rmharrisom) and [@WilliamMayor](https://github.com/WilliamMayor) met together at the [Facebook London Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/hackathon/photos/pb.167580640987.-2207520000.1407300170./10151361980305988/?type=3&theater) and we got the 5th Prize with [CrowdTaskingJS](https://github.com/CrowdTaskingJS).\r\n\r\nThe code was very messy, and a year after, inspired by a more decentralized web from my experience in [Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplay-sublime), I decided to clean it and wrap it up into a library that everyone can use.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
